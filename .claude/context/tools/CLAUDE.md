# üõ†Ô∏è GLOW SOCIAL TOOLS DOCUMENTATION - YOUR PROBLEM-SOLVING TOOLKIT

## üö® CRITICAL RULE: TOOLS FIRST, ALWAYS üö®

**STOP AND READ THIS CAREFULLY:**

When I ask you to do ANYTHING, your FIRST thought should be:
"Which tool, pattern, or command already exists for this?"

**NOT**: "Let me write new code from scratch"
**NOT**: "Let me create a new solution"
**INSTEAD**: "Let me use the appropriate tool that already exists"

## üéØ Core Tool Categories for Glow Social

### 1. Content Generation (Fabric Patterns)
**Location**: `~/.config/fabric/patterns/` and `~/Documents/projects/fabric/data/my_patterns/`

**Your Custom Patterns**:
- `glow_social_voice` - Transform any text into our brand voice
- `debug_existing_feature` - Diagnose broken features
- `plan_new_feature` - Plan implementation before coding
- `debug_mystery` - Investigate weird behavior
- `debug_regression` - Find why something stopped working
- `analyze_performance` - Identify bottlenecks

**Usage**: 
```bash
echo "corporate jargon text" | fabric --pattern glow_social_voice
echo "save button not working" | fabric --pattern debug_existing_feature

2. Web Development & Testing (Playwright MCP)
THIS IS HOW YOU SEE AND TEST THE APP!
üö® MANDATORY - ALWAYS USE THE MCP BRIDGE üö®

ALWAYS use --browser chrome --extension
This uses my real browser with all cookies and sessions
Opens NEW windows for troubleshooting (doesn't disrupt my work)

Common Glow Social Testing Tasks:
// Check if posts are displaying
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: "https://app.glowsocial.com/dashboard"})
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot() // See what's actually rendered

// Test scheduling interface
mcp__playwright__browser_click({element: "Schedule Post button", ref: "#schedule-btn"})

// Verify client content
mcp__playwright__browser_type({element: "search", ref: "#client-search", text: "Bob's Roofing"})
// Check if posts are displaying
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: "https://app.glowsocial.com/dashboard"})
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot() // See what's actually rendered

// Test scheduling interface
mcp__playwright__browser_click({element: "Schedule Post button", ref: "#schedule-btn"})

// Verify client content
mcp__playwright__browser_type({element: "search", ref: "#client-search", text: "Bob's Roofing"})
3. Database Operations (Supabase)
Common Queries We Need:
-- Check for duplicate posts
SELECT * FROM content_posts 
WHERE user_id = ? AND scheduled_for = ?
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Find missing posts
SELECT * FROM content_posts 
WHERE scheduled_for < NOW() 
AND published = false;

-- Check client subscriptions
SELECT * FROM subscriptions 
WHERE user_id = ? 
AND status = 'active';
Always Check:

Timezone issues (everything should be UTC)
User ID joins
The scheduled_for timestamps
The sweater incident taught us: CHECK THE DATABASE FIRST

4. Client Management Commands
Location: ${PAI_HOME}/.claude/commands/
Key Commands for Glow Social:

capture-learning.md - Document what went wrong and how we fixed it
generate-monthly-content.md - Create 12 posts for a client
analyze-client-performance.md - Check how their content is doing
onboard-new-client.md - Set up everything for a new client

5. Web Research
For Competitor & Industry Analysis:
Use ${PAI_HOME}/.claude/commands/web-research.md for:

Researching what competitors are posting
Finding industry trends
Getting content ideas
Understanding local market dynamics

DON'T use fetch for research - use the web-research command!
6. Deployment & Monitoring
Vercel Deployment:

Push to GitHub ‚Üí Vercel auto-deploys
Check environment variables are set
Verify Supabase connection strings
Test immediately after deploy

What to Check Post-Deploy:

Can users log in?
Are posts displaying?
Is scheduling working?
Are API routes responding?

7. Financial & Business Analytics
When I ask about business metrics:

Client retention rates
Monthly recurring revenue
Which industries perform best
Cost per client acquisition

Use the answer-finance-question command for parsing any financial documents.
üé§ Voice System for Agents
Task({
  description: "Fix database issue",
  prompt: `
    [TASK]

    [ALWAYS CHECK]
    - Database first (timezone issues?)
    - User ID joins
    - scheduled_for timestamps
  `,
  subagent_type: "engineer"
})
üìÅ AVAILABLE COMMANDS
Check these first - they solve complete problems!
ls ${PAI_HOME}/.claude/commands/

üéØ Remember Our Goals
Every tool usage should move us toward:

More modular - Solve once, reuse forever
More reliable - Consistent quality across all clients
More efficient - Less time per client
More scalable - Same effort for 10 or 1000 clients

üö´ What We DON'T Need

Pentesting tools (we're not a security company)
Stripe integration (we handle billing differently)
Advanced scraping (we don't scrape protected content)
Complex orchestration (Glow Social app handles this)

Focus on tools that help us:

Generate better content
Fix problems faster
Understand our clients
Scale efficiently
